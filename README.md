--------------------------------------------------
What I learned:
* Recursive methods (factorial, fibinacci sequence, etc)
* Implementing linked lists and deques (IntList, SLList, DLList (circular, dual), ArrayDeque, etc)
* Simple data structures (Lists, Sets, ArraySet)
* Test Driven Development (TDD), Unit Tests (JUnit)
* Higher Order Functions (HoFs)
* Interfaces, Implementation Interfaces, Casting
* Subtype polymorphism (Comparable, comparator, both go well with Collections)
* Abstract classes
* Packages, Java libraries
* Be aware of automatic conversion (auto boxing/unboxing)
* Widening, Immutability (Mutable, Immutable)
* Generic Methods
* Iteration (Iterable, Iterator)
* Throwing Exceptions (Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions)
* Asymptotic Analysis (Big theta, big O, big Omega notations)
* Binary Search, Merge Sort
* Amortized Analysis 
* Disjoint Sets (Quick Find, Quick Union, Weighted Quick UnionUF, WQU Path Compression)
* Trees (Tree Recursion, B-Trees, Rotating Trees, Red-Black Tree)
* Hashing (Hash Tables)
* Priority Queues and Heaps
* Tree Traversals (Pre, Post, In-Order) and Quad Trees (Range Finding)
* Graphs and Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS)
* Shortest Paths (Dijkstra’s Algorithm, A*)
* Minimum Spanning Tree (MSTs, SPTs, Cut Property)
* Dijkstra’s, Prim’s, Kruskal’s Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming (Directed Acyclic Graph a.k.a ‘DAG’, Longest Increasing Subsequence)
* Basic Sorting Algorithms (Selection Sort, HeapSort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort)
* Quicksort, a.k.a Partitioning
* Sorting Properties (Stability, Shuffling, Algorithmic Bounds)
* Radix Sort (Counting, LSD, MSD)
* Tries (a.k.a Retrieval Trees, Child Links Optimization)
* Compression (Huffman Coding, Compression Theory)
